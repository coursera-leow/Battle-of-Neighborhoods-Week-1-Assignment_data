Using the location services in Foursquare, I could explore in detailed whether Toronto has what New York offers to these travelers. It could be further refined by taking into account the ratings of these establishments in my study.
The findings will look like the following
Leisure Travelers
	Count	Count where Ratings above 7
Museums		
Theatres
